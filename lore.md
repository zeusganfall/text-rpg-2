# The Kingdom
The realm of **Eryndral** was once the heart of the continent, a land where light and shadow balanced under the protection of the **Celestial Veil**, a barrier woven by ancient kings to keep the primordial darkness at bay. The kingdom’s strength did not come from armies or gold but from its ruling bloodline, each monarch carrying fragments of the Veil within their spirit. With the barrier intact, crops flourished, seas remained calm, and monsters prowled only at the fringes. Now, with the Veil weakening, storms lash the land and forgotten horrors stir beneath the earth.

# The Princess
**Princess Elenya** is not merely heir to the throne—she is the last vessel of the Veil’s power. Unlike her ancestors, her fragment of light awakened fully, making her the keystone of the kingdom’s survival. She is known for wandering among common folk, healing the sick with a touch and listening to voices long ignored. Her compassion made her beloved, but it also marked her as a target. Without her presence, the Celestial Veil fractures, unraveling the kingdom’s defenses and exposing the world to encroaching darkness.

# The Antagonist
The sorcerer **Malveth the Hollow** seeks to unmake the Veil entirely. Once a court scholar, he discovered forbidden tomes describing the shadow beyond the stars. Twisted by ambition, he believes true freedom lies in releasing this ancient darkness, destroying the cycle of light that binds the world. To achieve this, he captured Elenya, intending to siphon her fragment of the Veil and shatter the last barrier. His growing cult spreads terror, turning villages into altars of despair.

# The Ultimate Goal
The player’s quest is not only to save a princess but to preserve the fragile balance that keeps the world alive. Elenya is more than royalty—she is the living thread holding back annihilation. To rescue her is to rescue all of Eryndral from becoming a wasteland consumed by endless night.
