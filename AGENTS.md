## System Tools (Behind-the-Scenes)

These are not ‚Äúagents‚Äù inside the world but **support tools** that make the game function.

### 1. Game Loop

* **Purpose:** Keeps the game running until the player quits.
* **Input:** Accepts number inputs for navigation and text commands for actions.
* **Output:** Prints results of each action (movement, combat, inventory, etc.).
* **Convention:** Runs as a `while True` loop, ends on a `quit` command.

### 2. Parser

* **Purpose:** Interprets input as either:

  * A **number** for navigation.
  * A **command** like `look`, `inventory`, `attack [monster]`.
* **Input Example:**

  ```
  2
  ```
* **Output Example:**

  ```python
  {"command": "go", "target": "Crumbling Catacombs"}
  ```

### 3. JSON Loader

* **Purpose:** Loads game data (locations, items, monsters) from `game_data.json`.
* **Input:** JSON file.
* **Output:** Python dictionaries and class objects (e.g., `Location`, `Item`, `Monster`).
* **Convention:** Always reference game entities by their `name` keys.

### 4. Output Formatter

* **Purpose:** Ensures consistent display of text (location headers, combat logs, inventory lists).
* **Input:** Game state data (player, location, combat events).
* **Output Example:**

  ```
  üìç Shademire Woods
  Twisted trees block out the sun. The air feels heavy, and faint eyes glimmer in the dark.
  Exits:
  1. South ‚Üí Luminaris
  Items: none
  Monsters: Goblin
  ```

### 5. Screen Management

* **Purpose:** Keeps the console readable by clearing old text.
* **Implementation:**

  ```python
  import os

  def clear_screen():
      if os.name == "nt":  # Windows
          os.system("cls")
      else:  # macOS / Linux
          os.system("clear")
  ```
* **Best Practice:**

  * Clear the screen **before** showing a new state (e.g., when entering a location).
  * In combat, show results clearly before the next clear.

---

## Data Source (game\_data.json)

* All game content (locations, monsters, items) is stored in `game_data.json`.
* **Input convention:** Load the JSON file at game start.
* **Output convention:** The game reads attributes and creates objects dynamically.

---

## Input and Output Conventions (Summary)

* **Input:**

  * Numbers for navigation (e.g., `1`, `2`).
  * Text commands for actions (e.g., `look`, `attack goblin`).
  * Case-insensitive.
  * Whitespace trimmed.

* **Output:** Plain text responses, may include:

  * Location descriptions.
  * Combat feedback.
  * Inventory changes.
  * Status updates (HP, monster defeat, item pickups).
